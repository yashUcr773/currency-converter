# Clerk Integration Guide

CSP (Content Security Policy) is now fully removed from both frontend and backend. No CSP headers or meta tags are set anywhere in the app.

If you experience any issues with Clerk, check the browser console for errors and ensure your network connection is stable. No CSP should block Clerk or any other third-party service.

- `index.html`: Added permissive CSP meta tag
- `vite.config.ts`: Added development server headers
- `vercel.json`: Production CSP headers
- `public/sw.js`: Service worker CSP headers

The current configuration should work with Clerk. If issues persist, try temporarily removing the CSP meta tag from `index.html`.
