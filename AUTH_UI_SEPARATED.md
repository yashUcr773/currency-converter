# 🎯 Authentication UI Moved to Separate Page

I've successfully moved the sign-in/sign-up banner, features, and promotional content to a dedicated page while keeping only clean header authentication controls on all tabs.

## ✅ Changes Made

### 🚀 **New Join Page Created**
- **Route**: `/join` - Dedicated authentication landing page
- **Features**: Comprehensive signup page with benefits, features, and call-to-actions
- **Content**: 
  - Hero section with compelling messaging
  - Feature showcase (6 key benefits)
  - Security and privacy section
  - Statistics display
  - Multiple call-to-action buttons
  - Trust indicators

### 🧹 **Main App Cleaned Up**
- **Removed**: Welcome banner from all tabs
- **Removed**: AuthCallToAction component from main flow
- **Removed**: Promotional content that appeared on every page
- **Result**: Clean, distraction-free main application interface

### 🎛️ **Updated Header Authentication**
- **Join Free Button**: Links to the new `/join` page
- **Sign In Button**: Modal sign-in (unchanged)
- **Clean Design**: Minimal header controls that don't interfere with main functionality
