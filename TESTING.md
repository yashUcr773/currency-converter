# Currency Input Testing Guide

## Testing the Fixed Currency Input Functionality

After fixing the currency input issue, here's how to test that everything is working correctly:

### 1. **Basic Input Testing**
- Open RateVault at `http://localhost:5173/`
- You should see 3 default currency cards: USD, EUR, GBP
- The USD card should initially show 100 in the input field
- The other currencies should show calculated converted amounts

### 2. **Input Interaction Testing**
- **Clear and type**: Click in any currency input field and clear it, then type a new number
- **Decimal values**: Try entering decimal values like 123.45
- **Empty field**: Clear a field completely - it should show empty, not 0
- **Cross-conversion**: Enter a value in EUR or GBP and verify USD updates correctly

### 3. **Real-time Conversion Testing**
- Change the value in USD (e.g., from 100 to 200)
- Verify that EUR and GBP amounts update automatically
- Change EUR amount and verify USD and GBP update
- All conversions should happen instantly as you type

### 4. **Edge Cases**
- Try entering 0 - the field should become empty
- Try entering very large numbers
- Try entering very small decimal numbers (e.g., 0.01)

### 5. **Add More Currencies**
- Click "Add Currency" 
- Search for and add currencies like JPY, CAD, AUD
- Test that inputs work correctly for the newly added currencies
- Verify cross-conversion works between all currencies

### Expected Behavior:
✅ **Input fields should be responsive and allow typing**
✅ **Values should update in real-time across all currency cards**
✅ **Empty fields should stay empty (not show 0)**
✅ **Decimal precision should be maintained**
✅ **All currencies should sync with each other when any value changes**

If any of these behaviors are not working, there may be additional issues to address.
