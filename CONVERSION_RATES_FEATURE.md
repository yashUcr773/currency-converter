# Currency Conversion Rate Feature

## Overview
Added comprehensive conversion rate display functionality that shows exchange rates relative to a base currency (USD by default) and allows dynamic switching of the base currency.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Default USD Base Rates**
- All currencies show their conversion rate relative to USD by default
- Displays as: "1 USD = X.XXXX [Currency]"
- Rates are calculated from the exchange rate API data

### 2. **Dynamic Base Currency Switching**
- Users can click on any conversion rate to set that currency as the new base
- All other currencies automatically update to show rates relative to the new base
- Visual feedback with hover effects and base currency indicator

### 3. **Visual Indicators**
- **Base Currency**: Green badge with ðŸ“ˆ icon and "Base Currency" label
- **Conversion Rates**: Clickable blue links with ðŸ”„ icon
- **Header Info**: Shows current base currency prominently

### 4. **Rate Calculation Logic**
- Handles complex conversions when base currency isn't USD
- Formula: `targetRate / baseRate` for cross-currency calculations
- Precise to 4 decimal places for better accuracy

## UI/UX Enhancements
